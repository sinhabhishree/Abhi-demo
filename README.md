Methodology:

Data Collection:

Upload and preprocess a dataset containing features such as Temperature (Â°C), Vibration (mm/s), Pressure (Pa), and RPM, along with a target column indicating maintenance status.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values by dropping incomplete rows.

Encode the target column if it is categorical.

Feature Selection:

Allow users to dynamically select features for model training and prediction.

Ensure compatibility by automatically linking user-selected features to the prediction model.

Data Scaling:

Standardize selected features using StandardScaler for better model performance.

Handling Data Imbalance:

Use SMOTE to oversample the minority class, ensuring balanced training data.

Dimensionality Reduction:

Apply PCA to visualize the dataset in two dimensions and reduce complexity.

Model Training and Optimization:

Utilize Optuna to fine-tune hyperparameters (e.g., n_estimators, max_depth) of the Random Forest Classifier.

Train the model on resampled data.

Real-Time Prediction:

Save the trained model and scaler as .pkl files for reuse.

Allow users to input feature values in real-time to obtain maintenance predictions.

Feature Importance Analysis:

Calculate and save feature importance scores to a CSV file, providing insights into the factors influencing predictions.

Evaluation Metrics:

Confusion Matrix: Evaluate the accuracy of predictions for both classes.

Classification Report: Provide precision, recall, and F1-score for detailed performance metrics.

ROC-AUC Score: Measure the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
